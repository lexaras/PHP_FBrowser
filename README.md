How to use it:

TODO(extra future upgrades):
SASS > style.css(del img, think about responsive design?)
BACK BUTTON functionality(do not allow to back into localhost dir)
Dragging files to upload them
Supporting/Excepting files(catch erorrs for unsupported files/logins etc)
Think about more functionality
